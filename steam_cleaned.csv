The Entrenched Pack contains:

• AT-47 Anti-Tank Emplacement: A well armored emplacement that has to be operated manually. Initially it was controlled by the standard Helldiver issue turret AI, but it was deemed far too volatile for automated operation.

• Anti-Personnel Barrier: An airdropped barbwire fence capable of slowing incoming enemies. The barbed wire itself does very little damage but will entangle pretty much anything before it can power through. Eventually things do get through, but hopefully the barrier will have bought the Helldivers some extra time to deal with the threat.

• SH-32 Directional Kinetic Shield: A shield pack occupying the backpack slot. It projects a shield in front of the wearer and will slow down incoming projectiles, significantly lowering their damage potential. While very powerful, it is limited in that it only protects its wearer from one direction."
